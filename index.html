    <h1>Hello</h1>

        The history of origami followed after the invention of paper and 
        was a result of paper's use in society. In the detailed Japanese 
        classification, origami is divided into stylized ceremonial origami 
        (儀礼折り紙, girei origami) and recreational origami 
        (遊戯折り紙, yūgi origami), and only recreational origami is generally 
        recognized as origami.[1][2] However, this page describes the history 
        of both ceremonial and recreational origami.

        The modern growth of interest in origami dates to the design in 1954 
        by Akira Yoshizawa of a notation to indicate how to fold origami models.
        [3][4] The Yoshizawa-Randlett system is now used internationally. Today 
        the popularity of origami has given rise to origami societies such as the 
        British Origami Society and OrigamiUSA. The first known origami social 
        group was founded in Zaragoza, Spain during the 1940s.
